# PyBV
A Python Implementation of the BV Homomorphic Encryption Scheme

The scheme was proposed by Lauter et al. in - Can Homomorphic Encryption be Practical? (https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/405.pdf) which was a variant of the Some-what homomorphic encryption scheme given by Brakerski et al. in - Fully Homomorphic Encryption from Ring-LWE and Security for Key Dependent Messages (http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~zvikab/localpapers/IdealHom.pdf).

The API can be imported using the command "import BV". It currently supports the following functions and classes:


## Setup

### OSX

```
brew cask install xquartz
brew install pari
brew link pari # optional
brew install swig
sh build.sh
```

### Ubuntu

- You'll need to [download and build pari-gp](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/unix/pari-2.9.3.tar.gz) from source.  Once built, you'll need to add Pari's build output folder to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that Pari's .so library can be found when we build PyBV.
- Then, install swig and build BV
```
sudo apt-get install swig
sh build.sh
```
- To test your installation, run the following command from your PyBV folder
```pythom -m unittest```

#### Troubleshooting
Anaconda users may get a cryptic error relating to *__cxa_throw_bad_array_new_length* when trying to import PyBV due to a conflict between C++ verions. Running the below commands should fix it.
```
conda remove -y libgcc
sh build.sh
```

## Functions:

### pari_init(pari_size, max_prime)   
   pari_init() is the function that needs to be called before dealing with this API. On importing the module, the module executes this statement automatically. pari_size defines the size of stack we'll be using, and max_prime defines the pre computed prime table. By default, pari_size is set to 2000000000, and max_prime is set to 2. Arguments: pari_size (int), max_prime (int)

### pari_close()   
   pari_close() function has to be called at the end of each program to clear the memory used.

## Classes:

### pari_GEN
    This class abstracts the GEN variable in C++, making it available through python interface. The class is compatible with +, *, /, -, __getitem__ , %, and print.
  * Class Data:
    1. value (GEN)
    
  * \_\_init\_\_(self, x)
    The constructor converts x to a GEN variable. Arguments: x(int)

### parameters
  * Class Data:
    1. n, Q, sigma (ints)
    2. q, t, F (pari_GEN)

### secret_key
  * Class Data:
    1. sk (pari_GEN)
    2. params (parameters)

  * \_\_init\_\_(self, sk = None, parmas = None)   
    The constructor initiates class data. Arguments: sk (pari_GEN), params (parameters)

  * decrypt(self, ct)   
    decrypt() method returns the plaintext (pari_GEN) encrypted in ciphertext ct. Arguments: ct (pari_GEN) 

  * serialize(self)   
    TO BE IMPLEMENTED

### public_key
  * Class Data:
    1. pk (pari_GEN)
    2. params (parameters*)

  * \_\_init\_\_(self, pk = None, params = None)   
    The constructor initiates the class data. Arguments: pk (pari_GEN), params (parameters*)

  * encrypt(self, pt)   
    encrypt() method returns the ciphertext (pari_GEN) which encrypts plaintext pt. Arguments: pt (pari_GEN)

  * serialize(self)   
    TO BE IMPLEMENTED

### key_pair
  * Class Data:
    1. sk (secret_key)
    2. pk (public_key)

### key_gen
  * generate_key(self, n, Q, T, sigma)   
    generate_key() method returns the keys, which is of type key_pair. Arguments: n (int), Q (int), T (int), sigma (int)

  * deserialize(self)   
    TO BE IMPLEMENTED

### ciphertext   
    The class is compatible with '+', '*', and '-' operators. It also supports mulitplication with plaintext (int) and batching.
  * Class Data:
    1. value (pari_GEN)
    2. pk (public_key*)

  * \_\_init\_\_(self, plaintext = None, pk)   
    The plaintext variable is either an int variable, or it is an int_list variable. The size of list has to be less than the degree of polynomials (paramter *n*) in the polynomial ring. The constuctor method takes two arguments: plaintext (int or int_list), pk (public_key*)

  * decrypt(self, sk)   
    decrypt() method returns the decrypted ciphertext which is pari_GEN variable. Arguments: sk (secret_key*)
